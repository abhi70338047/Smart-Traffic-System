Smart Traffic Management System

This project is a Smart Traffic Management System built using Python and Tkinter to simulate real-time traffic signal control at a four-way intersection. The system adjusts green signal duration based on the length of vehicle queues and prioritizes emergency vehicles when present. The interface provides a visual layout of roads, signal states, vehicle queues, and timer-based signal transitions. The goal is to demonstrate how automation and traffic logic can improve vehicle flow, reduce delays, and support intelligent transportation systems.
